LeadBooster Chatbot by Pipedrive is a chatbot plugin that captures visitors to your WordPress website and turns them from qualified leads into deals in your Pipedrive CRM account.

== Description ==

LeadBooster Chatbot by Pipedrive is a chatbot plugin that captures visitors to your WordPress website and turns them from qualified leads into deals in your Pipedrive CRM account.

Just customize your chatbots appearance, set up conversations from templates or by creating your own, and let your bot get to work engaging each of your website visitors. While greeting and offering them assistance, your bot is also pre-qualifying them as leads.

Hot leads are then assigned to the right sales reps and fed straight into your Pipedrive pipeline as deals. Your bot can even help visitors schedule calls and meetings with your sales reps that sync to their Pipedrive calendars. With leads flowing into your pipeline, your sales team has more time to focus on turning them into customers instead of tracking them down in the first place.

== Installation ==

If you’re not already organizing your sales with Pipedrive, you’ll need to sign up for an account and purchase LeadBooster as an add-on before installing this plugin.


To install the LeadBooster plugin, you’ll first need to create a playbook for your chatbot in your pipedrive.com account under **Pipeline Settings > Tools > LeadBooster**. After your playbook is ready, complete the following steps:

1. Under **Embed**, copy the code snippet under the **WordPress** section in the LeadBooster feature.
1. In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to **Plugins** and click on the **Add new** button.
1. Search for Leadbooster Chatbot by Pipedrive plugin, then **install** and **activate** it.
1. Once the plugin is activated, you will see a **Leadbooster Chatbot by Pipedrive** menu item under Settings in the WordPress dashboard.
1. Paste the copied code into the **Global Pipedrive JS code snippet** text field.
1. Click **Save settings**.
1. If you want to have different chatbots on different pages of your website, paste the respective playbook's code snippet into the text field next to the name of the specific page in WordPress.

Now enjoy while LeadBooster collects hot leads and you have more time to focus on selling!
